In ZeosDBO there is no correlation between them as it done in VCL. If your query is alive you must set RequestLive=true doesn't matter have you set CachedUpdates+UpdateObject or not. Otherwise, if RequestLive=false your query will be always read-only. UpdateObject can be used in non-cached mode as well as in cached mode.</li><li>Because of the limitations of dblibrary only the first 255 char is returned for char and varchar columns.</li><li>LargeInt fields are not completely supported in Delphi 4,5 and C++ Builder 4,5.</li><li>Sybase does not support procedure parameter type query. Though a workaround was possible for ASE12.5 and above.</li><li>Oracle provider for ADO is case sensitive for the table name when getting schema columns, the MS version is working right. Identifier convertion must be reviewed for ADO.</li><li>If you are using dbgrid, all the records will be fetched because of a call to recordcount (in scrollbar). You can avoid this behavior if you turn on the Filtered property. In this case you can achieve fast open even on bigger resultsets.</li><li>Midas <tt class="classname">IProviderSupport</tt> interface is not completely supported. It may cause problems with <tt class="classname">TDatasetProvider</tt> and <tt class="classname">TClientDataset</tt>. Full support for <tt class="classname">IProviderSupport</tt> interface will be added to version 6.2.</li></ol></div></div></body></html>
